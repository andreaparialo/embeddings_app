# Three-Tier Filtering System - December 2024

## Overview
The application now uses a sophisticated three-tier filtering system to balance search space efficiency with result relevance:

1. **Baseline Filters** - Applied to ALL searches before any other processing
2. **Pre-Filters** - Applied before similarity search to reduce search space
3. **Post-Filters** - Applied after similarity search for fine-grained control

## Filter Tiers Explained

### 1. Baseline Filters (Pre-Pre-Filters)
These filters create the foundational search space that applies to ALL queries:
- **Purpose**: Remove products that should never appear in any search results
- **Applied**: At index initialization, before any search begins
- **Impact**: Reduces total searchable embeddings

Current baseline filters:
- **SKU Status**: Only "In Line" (IL) products are searchable
- **Release Dates**: Excludes future releases (2026) and specific dates (2025-08-01)

### 2. Pre-Filters
These filters are applied before similarity search to efficiently narrow the search space:
- **Purpose**: Focus search on relevant product categories
- **Applied**: After baseline filters, before FAISS similarity search
- **Impact**: Improves search speed and relevance

Current pre-filters:
- `BRAND_DES` - Brand is critical for category definition
- `USERGENDER_DES` - Gender significantly affects product style
- `PRODUCT_TYPE_COD` - Product type (sunglasses vs optical) is fundamental

### 3. Post-Filters
These filters are applied after similarity search for detailed matching:
- **Purpose**: Fine-tune results without limiting visual similarity search
- **Applied**: After finding visually similar products
- **Impact**: Ensures exact match on less critical attributes

Examples of post-filters:
- `FITTING_DES` - Fitting style
- `RIM_TYPE_DES` - Rim type
- `STARTSKU_DATE` - Specific date matching
- Other user-selected columns not in pre-filter list

## Configuration

Edit `config_filtering.py` to control all three filter tiers:

### Baseline Filters Configuration
```python
# SKU STATUS BASELINE FILTER
BASELINE_STATUS_CODES = [
    'IL',  # Only include "In Line" products
]
ENABLE_BASELINE_STATUS_FILTER = True

# RELEASE DATE BASELINE FILTER
BASELINE_EXCLUDE_YEARS = [
    2026,  # Exclude all 2026 releases
]
BASELINE_EXCLUDE_DATES = [
    '2025-08-01',  # Exclude specific August 2025 release
]
ENABLE_BASELINE_DATE_FILTER = True
```

### Pre-Filter Configuration
```python
# Columns that should be used for pre-filtering
PREFILTER_COLUMNS = [
    'BRAND_DES',
    'USERGENDER_DES',
    'PRODUCT_TYPE_COD',
]

# Optional pre-filter columns (uncomment to activate)
OPTIONAL_PREFILTER_COLUMNS = [
    # 'FITTING_DES',
    # 'RIM_TYPE_DES',
]
```

## How It Works

1. **Index Initialization**: 
   - Baseline filters applied to create searchable index
   - Products not meeting baseline criteria are never indexed

2. **User Query**:
   - Pre-filters applied based on selected columns and source SKU values
   - FAISS searches only within pre-filtered embedding space
   
3. **Similarity Search**:
   - Visual similarity calculated only for pre-filtered products
   - Results ranked by visual similarity
   
4. **Post-Processing**:
   - Remaining filter columns applied to similarity results
   - Final filtered results returned

## Impact Analysis

### Current Settings:
- **Baseline filters**: ~10,000 products excluded (non-IL status + future dates)
- **Pre-filters**: Search space reduced by 90-95% per query
- **Post-filters**: Final refinement without affecting similarity quality

### Performance Benefits:
- Faster searches due to reduced embedding space
- More relevant results (brand/gender/type appropriate)
- Consistent exclusion of unavailable products

## Files Modified
- `config_filtering.py` - Three-tier filter configuration
- `optimized_faiss_search.py` - Applies baseline filters at initialization
- `batch_processor_optimized.py` - Implements pre and post filtering
- `batch_processor.py` - Implements pre and post filtering

## To Modify Filters

### Change Baseline Filters:
1. Edit `BASELINE_STATUS_CODES` to change searchable product statuses
2. Edit `BASELINE_EXCLUDE_YEARS/DATES` to change date exclusions
3. Set enable flags to `False` to disable
4. **Note**: Changes require application restart to rebuild index

### Change Pre-Filters:
1. Add/remove columns from `PREFILTER_COLUMNS`
2. Uncomment items in `OPTIONAL_PREFILTER_COLUMNS`
3. Keep list small (3-5 columns) for best performance

### Change Post-Filters:
- Any column not in pre-filter list automatically becomes a post-filter
- No configuration needed - happens automatically

## Best Practices

1. **Baseline Filters**: Use sparingly for universal exclusions
2. **Pre-Filters**: Include only high-level category columns
3. **Post-Filters**: Use for detailed matching requirements
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check filter group sizes in logs

## Benefits
- Prevents unavailable products from ever being searchable
- Dramatically improves search performance
- Maintains visual similarity quality
- Flexible configuration for different use cases
- Clear separation of concerns between filter types
