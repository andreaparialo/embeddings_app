# CRITICAL FILTERING FIX - December 2024

## Issue Summary
When using Excel Bulk Batch processor with multiple filter columns selected (but NOT STARTSKU_DATE), all search results incorrectly had the same STARTSKU_DATE as the input SKUs. This was a critical bug that nearly resulted in project termination.

## Root Cause
The system was applying ALL selected columns as mandatory PRE-filters before the image similarity search:
- With 11 columns selected, it required ALL 11 to match exactly
- This reduced the search space from 29,136 embeddings to 0-13 embeddings
- The few remaining products all happened to be from the same date as the input

## The Fix
Modified `batch_processor_optimized.py` to use a two-stage filtering approach:

### 1. Pre-filtering (Before Similarity Search)
Only critical columns that define the product category:
- `BRAND_DES`
- `USERGENDER_DES` 
- `PRODUCT_TYPE_COD`
- `MD_SKU_STATUS_COD` (if status filtering enabled)

### 2. Post-filtering (After Similarity Search)
All other selected columns are applied AFTER finding visually similar products:
- `CTM_FIRST_FRONT_MATERIAL_DES`
- `FITTING_DES`
- `FlatTop_FlatTop_1`
- `GRANULAR_SHAPE_AWS`
- `MACRO_SHAPE_AWS`
- `RIM_TYPE_DES`
- `bridge_Bridge_1`
- `browline_browline_1`

## Results
- **Before Fix**: 0-13 embeddings per filter group (0.0%), all results same date
- **After Fix**: ~230+ embeddings per filter group (0.8%), results span 18+ different dates

## Technical Details
The fix involved modifying the filter application logic in `batch_processor_optimized.py`:

```python
# Define pre-filter columns (only critical ones)
prefilter_columns = ['BRAND_DES', 'USERGENDER_DES', 'PRODUCT_TYPE_COD']

# Apply remaining filters after similarity search
for col in postfilter_columns:
    if col in all_filters and all_filters[col] is not None:
        # Apply filter to results
```

## Files Modified
- `batch_processor_optimized.py` - Split filtering into pre/post stages
- (Previously fixed: All path normalization issues in FAISS metadata)

## Testing
Verified with 2026-01-01 products:
- Input: 10 SKUs from same date
- Output: Results spanning 2019-2026 with proper distribution
- No date clustering when STARTSKU_DATE not selected as filter

## Impact
This fix ensures the image similarity search works as intended:
1. Finds visually similar products across the entire catalog
2. Then applies attribute filters to refine results
3. Provides diverse results instead of artificially constrained ones

## Date Fixed
